# Steps-in-making-a-Pull-Request<br>
Here is my own Step-by-step, simple instructions on how I can make a pull request (PR) for any repos I want on a PC<br><br>
Step 1: Choose the repo I want to make a PR for<br><br>
Step 2: Fork the repo to my own account<br><br>
Step 3: Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (Git is a prerequisite for the next steps, and Github Desktop will make the subsequent steps easier)<br><br>

Step 9: Press "Add repository"<br><br>
Step 10: Once the process is completed, press "Show in Explorer", or the hotkey ```Ctrl + Shift + D``` to view the files of your repository in Explorer
